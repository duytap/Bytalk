ByTalk is a minimal, cross-platform, peer-to-peer chat application built for privacy and simplicity.

It runs directly in the terminal - on both Linux and Termux - allowing users to chat securely without any centralized server.

Messages are protected with end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the sender and receiver can read them.

By Talk represents the idea of bypassing surveillance and bringing communication back to its roots - fast, direct, and private.

How to use:
    host:   python bytalk.py host [port]
    client: python bytalk.py connect <ip> [port]
